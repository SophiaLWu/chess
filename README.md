# Chess

This is a game of chess that is playable on the command line interface for two players.

Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on an 8x8 grid. Each player has 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. Each piece can move in different ways. The objective of the game is to essentially ‘checkmate’ the opponent’s king by placing it under threat of capture that is inescapable.
